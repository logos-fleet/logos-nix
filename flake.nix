    # WINDOWS TARGET ONLY. Deliberately a second, newer nixpkgs — the one
    # exception to this repo's "never add a separate nixpkgs pin" rule, scoped
    # so it can never reach a Linux or macOS build.
    #
    # Why: this pin exists for upstream's mingw cross fixes, which our native
    # pin predates — notably the libjpeg-turbo mingw-boolean.patch repair that
    # landed 2026-01-09. Without it the overlay has to carry that patch itself.
    #
    # IT IS *NOT* HERE TO FIX W1 (plugin DLL search), whatever an earlier
    # revision of this comment claimed. Qt loads plugins with a bare
    # LoadLibrary, so a module in its own directory cannot resolve a vendored
    # DLL sitting beside it. That was measured on real Windows against Nix-built
    # 6.9.2, and the belief that 6.11.1 fixed it came from an MSYS2 build — the
    # exact proxy this repo's own Stage 0b lesson says never to trust for
    # Qt-internals questions. Re-measured 2026-08-06 on real Windows against
    # THIS pin's Nix-built Qt 6.11.1 (QT_RUNTIME=6.11.1, verified off
    # Qt6Core.dll's version resource), module dir isolated:
    #     plain                          -> LOAD=FAILURE "The specified module
    #                                       could not be found."
    #     LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH  -> LOAD=SUCCESS, vendored DLL resolved
    #                                       from the module's own directory
    #     vendored DLL moved next to exe -> LOAD=SUCCESS  (control)
    # So W1 is real at 6.11.1 and is fixed in code, in logos-module's
    # LogosModule::loadFromPath (see src/win_dll_search.cpp), not by this pin.
    #
    # Cost: Windows ships Qt 6.11.1 while Linux/macOS stay on 6.9.2, and
    # logos-cpp-sdk notes "the QRO wire is Qt-version-sensitive". Every process
    # in a Logos node talks over same-machine local sockets / named pipes, so a
    # Windows install is internally consistent; there is no cross-platform QtRO
    # link today. Revisit if one is ever introduced.
    #
    # Pinned to the exact base that logos-co/nixpkgs@mingw-integration was
    # rebased onto, so that branch stays a byte-for-byte reference.
